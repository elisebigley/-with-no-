This blog post is more a reflection of a very important part of the digital: humans! We have spent quite a bit of our class discussion time on the relationship between the digital and the humanities. What struck a chord with me was not just the humanities aspect of the digital, but the HUMAN aspect of it. 

- I found myself critiquing the [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/) as if some magical unicorn was writing it. Basically, I was expecting it to be perfect. I had to step back and realize that another person was writing these tutorials, who probably encountered the same issues I did, and is just trying to make the tool easier for me based on his/her experience! What helped me realize this was 1, Professor Graham repeating this in seminar 2, doing tutorials myself. Explaining things to other people and realizing how difficult it is encouraged me to be more sympathetic to minor errors in these tutorials.

- Collaborative work, what!? We're historians who sit at our desks reading books all day. We don't work collaboratively. But, week after week on all of these tutorials I found our [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel bumpin' with questions, answers, and support. It was a completely different atmosphere than sharing the PDF file of the articles assigned for the class. We had to explore new tools and help each other along the way. 


- Also, GREAT way to dive back into group work: do a final project using tools and programs you are soooo not comfortable with. It's like some professor planned this. We had to not only learn the digital tools, but explain how to use them, and their value to other historians. Oh, and did I mention we had to do this collaboratively? Put us right out of our comfort zones, why don't ya Shawn. But, I must admit this group project with [Phoebe Mannell](https://github.com/phoebemannell) was such a rewarding experience! I didn't think I would like group work this much. Our different perspectives and contributions to the group, not to mention our combined fear of the digital, made for a really fun collaborative [experience](https://github.com/elisebigley/Did-Darwin-Crib-Wallace-A-Digital-History-Mystery-Resources)!

So, at the end of the day remember who is behind the digital: just us humans (until the AIs take over). We should be kind to each other in our attempts to understand this mysterious digital world. And we should do it together, obviously.
