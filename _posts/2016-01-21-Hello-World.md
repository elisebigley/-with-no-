title: Half of the Instructions Get You Nowhere
---
In the recent craze of attempting (and failing!) the tutorials for this class, I have come to realize a few important key factors in making the experience as smooth (and rage free) as possible. Once I had my epiphany, I realized that it was common sense: read the full instructions before you begin. My problem started with my fear of the tutorials. I felt reading the whole tutorial through before starting would overwhelm me with complicated instructions and terminology! While that is true in some cases, it is more beneficial to understand the entire process and desired outcome before you begin. 

For example, I was stuck on a section in the [Wget Tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget). If I had read the instructions beforehand, I would have known that a few steps ahead, installing [Brew](http://brew.sh/) was essential for this step! 

So, even if you do not fully understand the instructions in your first runthrough, keep on reading! You might end up realized that the answer to your problem in Step A is sitting in Step B. If you do this, you will avoid sending a million messages to your professor to fix the issue.
