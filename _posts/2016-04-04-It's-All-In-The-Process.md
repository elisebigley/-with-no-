title: It's All In The Process
---

Over the past 3 months (and academic year, really) I have come to appreciate the process more than the final product. Below I outline two of the ways the process affects our relationship with our data and the final product.

##Mapping our Process allows us to more easily get to the final Product.

In our final project, Phoebe and I shared thousands of messages back and forth (ok maybe that's an exaggeration), met up on multiple occasions, and may have thrown a few digital hissy fits from time to time.
We've talked a lot about our programming historian tutorials and writing our own tutorials and what value they have in digital history.
If you've been reading my other posts, you'll know I need to take notes or else I am lost. I hate ending up back at square one, especially in the world of digital history! I rely heavily on the tutorials and I find that my own notes end up being mini-tutorials for myself. Those small reminders of remembering to open certain programs in order to run another on Command Line make a big difference in a project!
This is why my twine may resemble more of a tool tutorial rather than a digital history game (although, you still have a mystery to solve) and that's largely because of my need for detailed notes and instructions to be successful on a digital project. It would be interesting to compare my tutorials to another person's and see if there are any obvious markers of what they value most in a digital tool or the digital process.

##The Process illustrates a lot about our data that the Final Product may not.

The act of doing is important because it demonstrates a lot more about your data than the results can. By working with Darwin's published letters I have come to appreciate my data differently. By cleaning, splitting, combining, then sifting through our data, I saw networks and connections I wouldn't necessarily have seen if I had read the text from beginning to end.
The process also allows us to become what I call 'cozy with the data'. There were parts of our project that the digital tools could not help us with. For example, we had to go through each individual letter (once we had narrowed them down to about 100 letters) and find the important information. While this was time consuming (and perhaps there are faster ways of doing this?) I was able to see connections between key players in Darwin's life. Then when I had placed all the information into Palladio and visualized the data, these connections were clear. Tools like Palladio allow you to make concrete any assumptions you had about networks in your qualitative data.
The process allowed me to combine the digital and the humanities and not only see the value in both, but see the value in combining these ways of knowing together.
