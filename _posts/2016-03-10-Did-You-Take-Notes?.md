title: Did You Take Notes?
---

This blog post will take us back to March 10th. On that fateful day, I tried to remember all that Professor Graham taught me about [ImageJ](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html) a few days prior. Did I remember anything? Sure, some things. But my memory could only take me and my work so far.

I looked for other tutorials, although I must say that tutorials for ImageJ are lacking. Although, it's not like I am in any position to create one myself. The following time I met with Professor Graham, I made sure to take notes, so that I could follow up with what I had done on my own.

It was this simple set of notes that allows me to continue working on ImageJ and create images like the one below. The image below is based off of the sample images provided in the ImageJ download package.
